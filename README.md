### 🧠 About Me

Driven by curiosity and resilience, I bridge **Cybersecurity**, **Computer Science**, and **Artificial Intelligence** to develop intelligent systems capable of predicting and preventing digital threats. My academic foundation in cybersecurity and software engineering has evolved into research exploring **AI-driven threat prediction** and **secure machine learning frameworks**.

Currently, I am conducting a research project titled *"Hybrid Deep Learning for Stock Market Prediction"*—a foundation for future applications in **AI-based cybersecurity threat modeling**. I will present this work at:
- 🏛️ **CURO Symposium, University of Georgia (2026)**  
- 🎓 **Barry University STEM Symposium (2026)**

---

### 💻 Current Research
- Developing **MLP and CNN-LSTM hybrid architectures** for predictive analytics.
- Designing adaptive **data pipelines** integrating financial and sentiment analysis.
- Exploring frameworks to extend these methods for **real-time threat detection** in cybersecurity environments.

### 🔐 Cybersecurity & Computer Science Foundation
- **Secure Web Portal (Software Engineering Project)** — Designed and implemented a secure, role-based dynamic web portal using Java, JSP, and MySQL with cryptographic hashing (SHA-256 + salt/pepper).
- **Digital Forensics Tutorial (Forensics Project)** — Conducted MFT and NTFS file analysis using FTK Imager and WinHex.
- **Vulnerability Assessment Collaboration** — Assisted a senior cybersecurity analyst with vulnerability scanning, SIEM monitoring, and incident response.
- **Applied Cryptography** — Implementing practical encryption protocols in coursework (AES, RSA, SHA family).
